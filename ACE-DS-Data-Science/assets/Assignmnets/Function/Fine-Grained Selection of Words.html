		Fine-Grained Selection of Words
Next, let’s look at the long words of a text; perhaps these will be more characteristic
and informative. For this we adapt some notation from set theory. We would like to
find the words from the vocabulary of the text that are more than 15 characters long.
Let’s call this property P, so that P(w) is true if and only if w is more than 15 characters
long. Now we can express the words of interest using mathematical set notation as
shown in (1a). This means “the set of all w such that w is an element of V (the vocabu-
lary) and w has property P.”
(1) a. {w | w ∈ V & P(w)}
b. [w for w in V if p(w)]
The corresponding Python expression is given in (1b). (Note that it produces a list, not
a set, which means that duplicates are possible.) Observe how similar the two notations
are. Let’s go one more step and write executable Python code:

	<p>Your Turn: Try out the previous statements in the Python interpreter,
and experiment with changing the text and changing the length condi-
tion. Does it make an difference to your results if you change the variable
names, e.g., using [word for word in vocab if ...]?</p>>
